		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			The Big Bang Theory is the leading explanation for how the universe began.
			It describes the universe's inception as a singularity, an infinitely
			small and dense point, which rapidly expanded about 13.8 billion years
			ago.
		</p>
		<h3>Breaking Down this Facsinating Theory:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h4>The Singularity and the Initial Expansion</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Singularity: The universe started as an incredibly hot and dense
						point, where all the laws of physics as we know them break down.
					</li>
					<li>
						Initial Expansion: This point underwent a sudden and massive
						expansion, not an explosion in space, but an expansion of space
						itself. This event is what we refer to as the Big Bang.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>The Early Universe</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Inflation: Immediately following the Big Bang, the universe expanded
						exponentially in a fraction of a second, a process known as cosmic
						inflation.
					</li>
					<li>
						Cooling and Formation of Particles: As the universe expanded, it
						cooled down, allowing quarks and gluons to form protons and
						neutrons.
					</li>
					<li>
						Nucleosynthesis: Within the first few minutes, these protons and
						neutrons combined to form the nuclei of light elements like
						hydrogen, helium, and small amounts of lithium.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Formation of Atoms and Cosmic Background Radiation</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Recombination: About 380,000 years after the Big Bang, electrons
						combined with nuclei to form neutral atoms, mostly hydrogen. This
						process is called recombination.
					</li>
					<li>
						Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): The decoupling of matter and
						radiation allowed photons to travel freely, creating the CMB, which
						we can observe today as a faint glow pervading the universe. The CMB
						is considered the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot
						of the early universe.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Formation of Structure</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Dark Matter: Invisible and mysterious, dark matter began to clump
						due to gravity, providing the scaffolding for the formation of
						galaxies and larger structures.
					</li>
					<li>
						Galaxy Formation: Gas condensed into the first stars and galaxies
						about 400 million years after the Big Bang, marking the beginning of
						the "Cosmic Dawn".
					</li>
					<li>
						Cosmic Web: Over billions of years, these galaxies grouped into
						clusters and superclusters, forming a vast, intricate cosmic web.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Evidence Supporting the Big Bang Theory</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Hubbleâ€™s Law: Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies are moving away
						from us, and the farther they are, the faster they move, indicating
						that the universe is expanding.
					</li>
					<li>
						CMB: The discovery of the CMB in 1965 provided strong evidence for
						the Big Bang, as it matches predictions for the remnant radiation
						from the early universe.
					</li>
					<li>
						Abundance of Light Elements: Observations of the relative
						proportions of hydrogen, helium, and lithium in the universe align
						with the predictions of Big Bang nucleosynthesis.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Current Understanding and Open Questions</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Dark Energy: Observations suggest the universe's expansion is
						accelerating, driven by a mysterious force termed dark energy.
					</li>
					<li>
						Early Universe Mysteries: Questions about what caused the Big Bang,
						the nature of the singularity, and what, if anything, preceded it
						remain topics of intense research and speculation.
					</li>
				</ul>
